# RoadReady - A Driving Test Route App
We aim to design the mobile  app “RoadReady” that transforms the way people learn to drive and prepare them for their driving test.

#### The app will have the following features:
- Driving Test Routes for each town
- Turn-by-turn directions
- Set of theory test questions
- Collection of learning material
- A platform where users can communicate with each other
- Personalised feedback

### To deliver this we will use the following:
